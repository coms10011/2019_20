A rich man has six gold coins he splits into three piles randomly, so
that each pile has at least one coin. The first pile he gives to his
daughter, the second to his son and the third he throws in the lake
for good luck. What chance does the daughter have of getting three or more coins.

\noindent \textbf{solution} The sample space is made up of all possible divisions in piles
\begin{eqnarray}
  X&=&\{(4,1,1),(3,2,1),(3,1,2),(2,3,1),(2,1,3),\cr &&(2,2,2),(1,4,1),(1,1,4),(1,3,2),(1,2,3)\}
\end{eqnarray}
The event that the daughter gets at least three coins is
\begin{equation}
  E=\{(4,1,1),(3,2,1),(3,1,2)\}
\end{equation}
If all divisions are equally likely
\begin{equation}
  P(E)=\frac{\#E}{\#X}=\frac{3}{10}
\end{equation}
